  **String Manipulation, Arrays and Control Statements**

*Initialize a string variable student Data containing a list of student names and their scores in the format of name score,".
Split the studen tData string into individual records using the split(", ") method, creating an array called `records`.**

*Create two ArrayLists, `studentNames` and `studentScores`, to store student names and their respective scores.**
 
 *Iterate through the `records` array to process each student's data individually. Inside the loop:*

Split each `record` into two parts (name and score) using the ":" delimiter.

Check if there are exactly two parts; if not, print an error message and exit the program.

Add the student's name to the `studentNames` list.

Try to parse the score as an integer and add it to the `studentScores` list. If parsing fails,
 print an error message and exit the program.

After processing all records, calculate various statistics about the students:

Calculate the total number of students (size of `studentNames` list).

Calculate the total score of all students.

Track the highest and lowest scores and their respective scorers.

Print out the calculated statistics:

Total number of students.

Average score of all students.

Highest score and the student who achieved it.

Lowest score and the student who achieved it.
