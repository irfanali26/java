                                          **CALCULATOR**
 The program begins by importing the necessary Java libraries, including `java.util.Scanner`.

 It defines a `Calculator` class with the `main` method as the entry point of the program.

 Inside the `main` method, a `Scanner` object named `input` is created to read user input.
Three variables, `num1`, `num2`, and `result`, are declared to store numeric values, and a variable

`operator` is declared to store the operator for calculations.

 A welcome message is displayed to the user.

 The program enters a continuous loop using a `while (true)` statement, allowing the user to perform multiple
 calculations until they choose to exit.

 The program prompts the user to enter an expression (e.g., "5 + 10") or type "exit" to quit.

 The user's input is read as a string into the `expression` variable.

 If the user enters "exit," the program displays a farewell message and exits the loop and program.

 The input expression is split into tokens (separated by spaces), and the tokens are stored in the `tokens` array.

If the number of tokens is not equal to 3, an error message is displayed, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

 The program attempts to parse the first number, operator, and second number from the tokens. If this parsing is successful, these values 
are stored in the `num1`, `operator`, and `num2` variables, respectively. If an error occurs (e.g., invalid numbers or operator), an error message is 
displayed, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Depending on the operator, the program performs the corresponding calculation using a `switch` statement. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. Division by zero is also checked to avoid errors.

The result of the calculation is displayed to the user in the format "Result: num1 operator num2 = result."

 The program then returns to the start of the loop, allowing the user to enter another expression or exit by typing "exit."

 If the user types "exit," the program displays a farewell message and terminates
